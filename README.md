#Application Aliaser

Directory for ZSH. The script is essentially the same. Just some default paths are changes for ZSH defaults.

This shell script is a simple solution that creates aliases for every application in the /Applications/ directory.
It also appends this aliases to be added to bash_profile so that the aliases exist for every session.

Download the ApplicationAliaser.sh and run by navigation to the directory and running "./ApplicationAliaser.sh"
